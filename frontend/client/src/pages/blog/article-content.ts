  <h2 id="what-is-health-insurance">What Is Health Insurance?</h2>
  <p>A cardiac bypass surgery in Mumbai costs ${formatMoney("₹8L–₹12L")}. A routine appendicitis operation: ${formatMoney("₹80k–₹1.5L")}. ICU care for a week: ${formatMoney("₹2L–₹5L")}.</p>
  
  <p>Healthcare costs in India's metros are rising faster than your salary. ${formatMoney("₹5L+ annual healthcare spending")} per family isn't unusual. One major surgery can wipe out years of savings.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Health insurance is an agreement between you and an insurance company.</strong> You pay a premium (monthly or annually). If you get hospitalized, the insurer pays the hospital bills—up to a limit.</p>
  
  <p>Here's how it works in real numbers: You pay ${formatMoney("₹5,000/month")} premium. Your policy covers ${formatMoney("₹5L–₹10L")} per year. If you need surgery costing ${formatMoney("₹3L")}, the insurer pays it (minus any co-pay or deductibles). You pay ${formatMoney("₹0–₹30k")} instead of ${formatMoney("₹3L")}.</p>
  
  <h3 id="how-health-insurance-works">How Health Insurance Works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Take a policy:</strong> Choose a sum insured (coverage amount), pay premium.</li>
    <li><strong>Get hospitalized:</strong> For illness, injury, or planned surgery.</li>
    <li><strong>File a claim:</strong> Cashless (if hospital is empaneled) or reimbursement (pay first, claim later).</li>
    <li><strong>Insurer pays:</strong> Hospital bills covered up to your sum insured, minus room limits, co-pay, deductibles.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Real scenario:</strong> Priya, 32, Mumbai. Needs appendicitis surgery. Total bill: ${formatMoney("₹1.2L")}. Her policy: ${formatMoney("₹5L sum insured")}, ${formatMoney("₹3k/day room limit")}, ${formatMoney("10% co-pay")}.</p>
  
  <p>Room cost: ${formatMoney("₹5k/day × 3 days = ₹15k")} (exceeds ₹3k/day limit by ${formatMoney("₹2k/day = ₹6k total")}). Co-pay: ${formatMoney("10% of ₹1.2L = ₹12k")}. Her out-of-pocket: ${formatMoney("₹6k + ₹12k = ₹18k")}. Insurer pays: ${formatMoney("₹1.02L")}.</p>
  
  <h3 id="key-components">Key Components Explained</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Sum Assured (Coverage Limit):</strong> Maximum amount insurer pays per year. ${formatMoney("₹5L–₹10L")} common for individuals, ${formatMoney("₹10L–₹25L")} for families. If your bill exceeds this, you pay the excess.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Premium:</strong> What you pay monthly or annually. Depends on age, city, sum insured, medical history. A 30-year-old in Delhi pays ${formatMoney("₹5k–₹8k/year")} for ${formatMoney("₹5L")} coverage. Same person at 50: ${formatMoney("₹12k–₹18k/year")}.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Room Rent Limit:</strong> Maximum per day the insurer covers for your hospital room. ${formatMoney("₹2k–₹5k/day")} typical. If you choose a ${formatMoney("₹8k/day")} room, you pay ${formatMoney("₹3k/day")} extra—and that triggers a proportional deduction on ALL charges (surgery, medicines, ICU).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Co-pay Percentage:</strong> You pay X%, insurer pays the rest. ${formatMoney("10–20%")} common. Applied to every claim. Not optional.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Deductible/Excess:</strong> Fixed amount you pay first before insurer pays anything. ${formatMoney("₹5k–₹25k")} typical. Example: ${formatMoney("₹10k deductible")}, ${formatMoney("₹1L bill")} → You pay ${formatMoney("₹10k")}, insurer pays ${formatMoney("₹90k")}.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Waiting Periods:</strong> Time before certain conditions are covered. Pre-existing diseases: ${formatMoney("24–48 months")}. Specific ailments (cataract, hernia): ${formatMoney("12–24 months")}.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Exclusions:</strong> What's NOT covered. Cosmetic surgery, dental (except accidental), consumables (gloves, syringes), alternative medicine (AYUSH) usually excluded.</p>
  
  <h3 id="plan-types">Main Plan Types in India</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Individual Health Insurance:</strong> Covers one person. Premium: ${formatMoney("₹5k–₹10k/year")} for ${formatMoney("₹5L")} coverage. Best for: Singles, young professionals without dependents.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Family Floater Policies:</strong> Covers entire family under one sum insured. Premium: ${formatMoney("₹15k–₹25k/year")} for ${formatMoney("₹10L–₹20L")} shared coverage. Best for: Families of 2–4 members. Risk: One major claim exhausts the limit for all.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Group Health Insurance:</strong> Provided by employer. Premium: Employer pays, or shared. Coverage: Usually ${formatMoney("₹3L–₹5L")} per employee. Best for: Employees (it's free or subsidized). Limitation: Coverage ends when you leave the job.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Critical Illness Covers:</strong> Lump sum payout on diagnosis of specified diseases (cancer, heart attack, stroke). ${formatMoney("₹5L–₹50L")} payout. Separate from health insurance. Premium: ${formatMoney("₹10k–₹30k/year")} for ${formatMoney("₹10L")} cover.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Mediclaim vs Health Insurance:</strong> Mediclaim is the old term (pre-2013). Modern "health insurance" includes pre/post hospitalization, OPD, wellness benefits. Same thing, different name.</p>
  
  <h3 id="benefits">Key Benefits of Health Insurance</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Peace of mind:</strong> You don't worry about medical bills wiping out savings.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Covers major medical expenses:</strong> Hospitalization, surgery, ICU, emergency care—all covered.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Preventive care (some plans):</strong> Health check-ups, vaccinations covered up to a limit.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tax benefits (Section 80D):</strong> Premium payments are tax-deductible. Up to ${formatMoney("₹25k/year")} for self/spouse/children, ${formatMoney("₹50k/year")} if parents included.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Add-on riders:</strong> Maternity, personal accident, critical illness can be added for extra premium.</p>
  
  <h3 id="misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h3>
  
  <p><strong>"Health insurance covers everything":</strong> NO. Room limits, co-pay, deductibles, exclusions mean you still pay out-of-pocket. Expect ${formatMoney("₹20k–₹50k")} per hospitalization even with insurance.</p>
  
  <p><strong>"I'm young, don't need it":</strong> Risk exists at any age. Accidents, appendicitis, infections don't care about your age. Plus, premiums are cheaper when you're young (${formatMoney("₹5k/year")} at 30 vs ${formatMoney("₹18k/year")} at 50).</p>
  
  <p><strong>"Government insurance is enough":</strong> Government schemes (Ayushman Bharat) cover ${formatMoney("₹5L")} but only for below-poverty-line families. Private employees need private insurance.</p>
  
  <h3 id="real-world-scenario">Real-World Scenario</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Case:</strong> Rohan, 35, Mumbai. ${formatMoney("₹5L health insurance")} policy. Gets appendicitis surgery.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Hospital bill:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹50k")} total.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Policy details:</strong> Room limit ${formatMoney("₹3k/day")} (actual room: ${formatMoney("₹4k/day")}). Co-pay: ${formatMoney("10%")}. No deductible.</p>
  
  <p><strong>What policy covers:</strong> Room excess: ${formatMoney("₹1k/day × 2 days = ₹2k")} (proportional deduction applies, but simplified here). Co-pay: ${formatMoney("10% of ₹50k = ₹5k")}. Total out-of-pocket: ${formatMoney("₹7k")}. Insurer pays: ${formatMoney("₹43k")}.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Without insurance:</strong> Rohan would pay ${formatMoney("₹50k")} himself. With insurance: ${formatMoney("₹7k")}. Savings: ${formatMoney("₹43k")}.</p>

export const article9FAQs = [
  {
    question: "Is health insurance mandatory in India?",
    answer: "No, health insurance is not mandatory for individuals in India. However, it's highly recommended due to rising healthcare costs. Government employees may have mandatory coverage through CGHS/ESIC schemes."
  },
  {
    question: "What age can I buy health insurance?",
    answer: "You can buy health insurance from 18 years old. The entry age limit is usually 65 years. Some plans allow coverage up to 80 years with higher premiums. Buy early—premiums are lower when you're young."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim if I don't have a policy upfront?",
    answer: "No. Health insurance doesn't cover pre-existing conditions immediately (24–48 month waiting period). You cannot buy insurance after getting sick and claim immediately. Buy insurance when you're healthy."
  },
  {
    question: "Do pre-existing conditions require waiting period?",
    answer: "Yes. Diabetes, hypertension, cardiac issues, etc. have a waiting period of 24–48 months from policy start date. Claims for these conditions are denied during the waiting period. This is standard across all insurers."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple health policies?",
    answer: "Yes, you can have multiple policies. But you cannot claim the same hospitalization from multiple insurers (no double-dipping). You can use one policy per claim, or use policies sequentially if one exhausts."
  },
  {
    question: "Is maternity covered?",
    answer: "Maternity is usually NOT covered in standard health insurance. It's available as an add-on rider for extra premium, with a waiting period of 24–36 months. Coverage includes delivery, C-section, and complications up to ₹50k–₹1L."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the claim process?",
    answer: "Cashless: Choose empaneled hospital, inform insurer before admission, get pre-authorization, treatment happens, insurer pays directly. Reimbursement: Pay hospital yourself, collect bills, submit claim form + bills to insurer within 15–30 days, get reimbursed."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I carry forward unused benefits?",
    answer: "No. Health insurance is annual. Unused sum insured doesn't carry forward to next year. If you don't claim, the premium you paid is gone (that's how insurance works—you're buying protection, not savings)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is health insurance tax-deductible?",
    answer: "Yes. Premium payments are deductible under Section 80D. Self/spouse/children: Up to ₹25k/year. Parents (senior citizens): Additional ₹50k/year. Total deduction possible: ₹75k/year if both you and senior citizen parents are covered."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I don't disclose pre-existing condition?",
    answer: "Your policy can be cancelled, claims denied, and you may face legal action for fraud. Always disclose pre-existing conditions honestly. The waiting period applies, but at least you're covered after that period ends."

// Article 10: What Is Life Insurance?
export const article10Content = `
<div class="blog-article-content">
  <h2 id="what-is-life-insurance">What Is Life Insurance?</h2>
  <p>If you die today, is your family financially secure?</p>
  
  <p>The average Indian earner makes ${formatMoney("₹8–12L/year")}. If you die suddenly, that income stops. Your family still has: home loan EMI (${formatMoney("₹30k–₹50k/month")}), kids' education (${formatMoney("₹5L–₹10L/year")} per child), daily expenses (${formatMoney("₹40k–₹60k/month")}).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Life insurance is an agreement:</strong> You pay a premium. If you die during the policy term, the insurer pays your family a lump sum (sum assured). That money replaces your income, repays loans, funds education, covers expenses.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Real example:</strong> Ravi, 35, earns ${formatMoney("₹30L/year")}. Buys ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} term life policy. Premium: ${formatMoney("₹500/month")}. If Ravi dies, his family gets ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} tax-free. That's ${formatMoney("3+ years")} of his income, enough to pay off home loan (${formatMoney("₹50L")}), fund kids' education (${formatMoney("₹30L")}), and living expenses (${formatMoney("₹20L")}).</p>
  
  <h3 id="how-life-insurance-works">How Life Insurance Works</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You pay monthly/annual premium to the insurer.</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Insurer invests your premium money (that's how they make profit).</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you die during the policy term, insurer pays sum assured to your nominee (beneficiary).</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you survive the term (term insurance), you get nothing. If you have whole life/endowment, you get maturity benefit.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Real scenario:</strong> Priya, 35, software engineer. ${formatMoney("₹1cr term life")} policy, ${formatMoney("₹500/month")} premium, 30-year term. If she dies in year 5, her family gets ${formatMoney("₹1cr")}. If she survives all 30 years, she gets nothing (premium is the cost of protection).</p>
  
  <h3 id="types-of-life-insurance">Types of Life Insurance</h3>
  
  <h4 id="term-life">Term Life Insurance</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> Pure protection. Pay premium. If you die → family gets sum assured. If you survive → nothing. Cheapest option.</p>
  <p><strong>Who:</strong> Anyone protecting dependents. Young professionals, parents, breadwinners.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹300–₹500/month")} for ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} coverage (age 30). ${formatMoney("₹800–₹1,200/month")} for same coverage at age 45.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} term life, 30-year term, age 35: ${formatMoney("₹400/month")} premium. If death: ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} to family. If survival: ${formatMoney("₹0")} (protection cost).</p>
  
  <h4 id="whole-life">Whole Life Insurance</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> Lifelong protection + investment component. Covers you until death (age 99–100). Premiums higher, includes cash value buildup.</p>
  <p><strong>Who:</strong> High-income earners, estate planning, wealth transfer.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹3,000–₹5,000+/month")} for ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} coverage. Expensive, but builds cash value you can borrow against.</p>
  
  <h4 id="endowment">Endowment Plans</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> Mixed: protection + savings + maturity benefit. If you die → family gets sum assured. If you survive → you get sum assured (or higher) as maturity benefit.</p>
  <p><strong>Who:</strong> Risk-averse investors who want guaranteed returns + protection.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹2,000–₹4,000/month")} for ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} coverage. Premiums 4–6× higher than term life, but you get money back if you survive.</p>
  <p><strong>Returns:</strong> Typically ${formatMoney("5–6%")} annual returns (guaranteed), lower than mutual funds but safer.</p>
  
  <h3 id="key-terms">Key Terms Explained</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Sum Assured:</strong> Amount your family gets if you die. ${formatMoney("₹50L–₹2cr")} typical range. Should be 10–15× your annual income.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Premium:</strong> What you pay monthly/annually. Depends on age, sum assured, policy type, health, occupation. Term life: ${formatMoney("₹300–₹500/month")} for ${formatMoney("₹1cr")}. Endowment: ${formatMoney("₹2k–₹4k/month")} for same.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Maturity Benefit:</strong> Money you get if you survive the policy term (endowment/whole life only). Term life has NO maturity benefit.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Riders:</strong> Additional covers for extra premium. Accident death (2× sum assured), critical illness (lump sum on diagnosis), disability income (monthly payout if disabled).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Claim Settlement Period:</strong> Time insurer takes to pay claim after your death. Typically ${formatMoney("30–90 days")} if documents are complete. IRDAI mandates quick settlement (most insurers settle within 7–15 days for standard cases).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Waiting Period:</strong> Suicide claims: ${formatMoney("12 months")} (standard exclusion). Pre-existing diseases (critical illness rider): ${formatMoney("90 days–1 year")}.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Policy Tenure:</strong> How long the policy runs. Term life: ${formatMoney("10–40 years")} (you choose). Whole life: Until age 99–100. Endowment: ${formatMoney("15–30 years")} typical.</p>
  
  <h3 id="who-needs">Who Needs Life Insurance?</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Breadwinners with dependents:</strong> If your family relies on your income, you need life insurance. Coverage: 10–15× annual income minimum.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Young professionals with loans:</strong> Home loan (${formatMoney("₹50L+")}), car loan (${formatMoney("₹10L+")}). If you die, family inherits the debt. Life insurance pays off loans.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Parents wanting to secure child's future:</strong> Education costs ${formatMoney("₹20L–₹50L")} per child (engineering/medical). Life insurance ensures education funding even if you die.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Business owners:</strong> Key person insurance protects business if founder dies. Business loan coverage ensures company survives.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Stay-at-home parents:</strong> Even without income, they provide childcare (worth ${formatMoney("₹30k–₹50k/month")} if hired). Life insurance covers cost of replacement care.</p>
  
  <h3 id="benefits">Life Insurance Benefits</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Family financial security:</strong> Replaces your income if you die. ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} coverage = ${formatMoney("8–10 years")} of ₹10L/year income.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Debt repayment:</strong> Home loan (${formatMoney("₹50L")}), personal loans cleared. Family isn't burdened.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Education funding:</strong> Kids' education (${formatMoney("₹30L+")} per child) secured even if you die.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Tax benefits:</strong> Premium payments deductible under Section 80C (up to ${formatMoney("₹1.5L/year")}). Death benefit is tax-free (Section 10(10D)).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Wealth creation:</strong> Endowment/whole life build cash value. Maturity benefit can be ${formatMoney("₹1cr+")} for retirement corpus.</p>
  
  <h3 id="real-scenario">Real-World Scenario</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Case:</strong> Vikram, 32, Mumbai. ${formatMoney("₹12L annual income")}. Two kids (ages 5 and 7). Home loan: ${formatMoney("₹50L")} remaining. Buys ${formatMoney("₹1cr term life")} policy, ${formatMoney("₹400/month")} premium, 30-year term.</p>
  
  <p><strong>If Vikram dies:</strong> Family gets ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} tax-free.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Home loan repayment: ${formatMoney("₹50L")}</li>
    <li>Kids' education (₹15L × 2): ${formatMoney("₹30L")}</li>
    <li>Living expenses buffer (2 years @ ₹10L/year): ${formatMoney("₹20L")}</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Total: ₹1cr</strong> - exactly covered.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Without insurance:</strong> Family inherits ₹50L debt, no income, kids' education uncertain. With insurance: Financial security maintained.</p>
  
  <h3 id="misconceptions">Common Misconceptions</h3>
  
  <p><strong>"Only breadwinners need life insurance":</strong> Wrong. Stay-at-home parents provide childcare worth ₹30k–₹50k/month. If they die, family needs to hire help. Life insurance covers that cost.</p>
  
  <p><strong>"Life insurance is investment":</strong> Term life is NOT investment (you get nothing if you survive). Endowment/whole life ARE investments (you get maturity benefit), but returns are lower (5–6%) than mutual funds (10–12%).</p>
  
  <p><strong>"Young people don't need it":</strong> Wrong. Premiums are cheapest when you're young (₹400/month at 30 vs ₹1,200/month at 45 for same ₹1cr coverage). Buy early, lock in low rates.</p>
  
  <p><strong>"I'll get it later":</strong> Premiums increase with age. Health issues (diabetes, hypertension) can make you uninsurable or expensive to insure. Buy when you're young and healthy.</p>

export const article10FAQs = [
  {
    question: "How much life insurance do I need?",
    answer: "Aim for 10–15× your annual income minimum. Include: outstanding loans (home, car), kids' education costs (₹20L–₹50L per child), 2–3 years of living expenses. Example: ₹12L/year income → ₹1.2cr–₹1.8cr coverage needed."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between term and endowment?",
    answer: "Term life: Cheap (₹400/month for ₹1cr), pure protection, no maturity benefit. Endowment: Expensive (₹2k–₹4k/month for ₹1cr), protection + savings, maturity benefit if you survive. Term is better for pure protection; endowment is better if you want guaranteed returns."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple life insurance policies?",
    answer: "Yes. You can have multiple policies from different insurers. All payouts are independent—if you have 2× ₹1cr policies and die, your family gets ₹2cr total. There's no limit on coverage amount."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I stop paying premium?",
    answer: "Term life: Policy lapses, no coverage. No surrender value. Endowment/whole life: Policy may have surrender value (cash you get back). Some policies have grace period (30 days) to pay missed premium. After that, policy lapses."
  },
  {
    question: "Is life insurance claim denied often?",
    answer: "No. Life insurance claims have 97–98% settlement rate in India (IRDAI data). Denials usually happen due to: non-disclosure of pre-existing disease, suicide within 12 months, death due to excluded causes (war, hazardous activities), fraud."
  },
  {
    question: "Do suicide claims get paid?",
    answer: "After 12 months waiting period, yes. Suicide claims are excluded for first 12 months of policy. After 12 months, they're covered and paid to nominee. This is standard across all life insurance policies in India."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I increase sum assured mid-policy?",
    answer: "Usually no for term life (fixed sum assured). Some policies allow sum assured increase on life events (marriage, childbirth) with premium adjustment. Endowment policies may allow top-up riders."
  },
  {
    question: "Is life insurance mandatory in India?",
    answer: "No, life insurance is not mandatory. However, if you have dependents (family, loans, financial obligations), it's essential. Some employers provide group life insurance as part of benefits."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I have health issues?",
    answer: "You may still get coverage, but: Premiums higher, sum assured may be reduced, certain conditions excluded (e.g., heart disease). Medical examination required. Some insurers decline coverage for severe conditions (cancer, advanced diabetes)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get life insurance if I smoke?",
    answer: "Yes, but premiums are 50–100% higher. Smokers pay ₹600–₹800/month for ₹1cr term life vs ₹400/month for non-smokers. Some insurers may decline coverage for heavy smokers with health issues."

<div class="blog-article-content">
  <h2 id="car-insurance-explained">Car Insurance Explained</h2>
  <p>India sees ${formatMoney("1.5 lakh+ road deaths")} annually. ${formatMoney("5 lakh+ accidents")} every year. Your car is involved in an accident. Damage to your car: ${formatMoney("₹2L")}. Damage to third party's car: ${formatMoney("₹50k")}. Hospital bills for injured third party: ${formatMoney("₹3L")}.</p>
  
  <p>Without vehicle insurance, you pay ${formatMoney("₹5.5L")} yourself. With insurance, you pay ${formatMoney("₹0–₹5k")} (deductible). The rest is covered.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Vehicle insurance protects:</strong> Your car + third party (other person's car/property/injuries). You pay premium. Insurer pays repair costs or liability claims.</p>
  
  <h3 id="two-types">Two Types of Vehicle Insurance</h3>
  
  <h4 id="third-party">Third-Party Liability Insurance (Mandatory)</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> You damage someone else's car/property/health. Insurer pays third party's costs. You pay nothing (if liability proven).</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹2,000–₹4,000/year")} for cars. Mandatory by law (Motor Vehicles Act).</p>
  <p><strong>Limitation:</strong> Your car damage NOT covered. Only third-party liability.</p>

  {
    question: "Is vehicle insurance mandatory in India?",
    answer: "Yes. Third-party liability insurance is mandatory by law (Motor Vehicles Act). Driving without insurance is a criminal offense, punishable with fine and/or imprisonment. Comprehensive insurance is optional but highly recommended."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between IDV and sum assured?",
    answer: "IDV (Insured Declared Value) = your car's current market value (depreciated). Sum assured = same thing in life insurance terms. IDV determines premium (higher IDV = higher premium) and maximum claim amount."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I transfer NCB between vehicles?",
    answer: "Yes, if you sell your old car and buy a new one, you can transfer NCB to the new car's policy. Valid for 3 years from policy expiry. Must buy new policy within 90 days of old policy expiry."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my car is stolen?",
    answer: "Comprehensive insurance covers theft. Report to police within 24 hours, file FIR. Claim process takes 30–60 days. If car not recovered after investigation, insurer pays IDV (minus depreciation if policy doesn't have zero dep add-on)."
  },
  {
    question: "Is rental car damage covered?",
    answer: "Usually no, unless your policy specifically includes rental car coverage (rare). Your personal car insurance doesn't cover rental cars. You need separate insurance from rental company."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate coverage for bike + car?",
    answer: "Yes. Each vehicle needs its own policy. You cannot have one policy covering multiple vehicles. Premiums are separate for each vehicle."
  },
  {
    question: "What if third party is uninsured?",
    answer: "Your third-party liability still covers them. Their insurance status doesn't matter—your insurance pays for damage you cause to them, whether they're insured or not."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim for depreciation?",
    answer: "Depreciation is deducted from claim (unless you have zero dep add-on). Car parts: 50% depreciation after 6 months. Tyres/batteries: 50% after 1 year. Paint/plastic: 30% after 6 months. Zero dep add-on removes this deduction."
  },
  {
    question: "Is insurance premium tax-deductible?",
    answer: "No. Vehicle insurance premium is NOT tax-deductible (unlike health/life insurance). However, if car is used for business, premium can be deducted as business expense."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I sell my car mid-policy?",
    answer: "Cancel the policy, get refund for remaining months (pro-rata basis). Transfer NCB to new car (if buying within 90 days). Or transfer policy to new owner (with insurer approval and documentation)."

export const article12Content = `
<div class="blog-article-content">
  <h2 id="what-is-home-insurance">What Is Home Insurance?</h2>
  <p>Fire, theft, floods, earthquakes damage ${formatMoney("₹crores")} worth of property in India every year. Your ${formatMoney("₹50L–₹1cr")} home is likely your biggest asset. One fire, one flood, one earthquake—and it's gone.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Home insurance protects your house and belongings.</strong> You pay annual premium. If fire, theft, natural disaster damages your home, insurer covers repair/replacement costs.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Real example:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹50L home")}, ${formatMoney("₹50k annual premium")}. Fire damage: ${formatMoney("₹2L")} (walls, roof, fixtures). Insurer pays: ${formatMoney("₹2L")}. Your cost: ${formatMoney("₹0")} (minus deductible maybe ${formatMoney("₹5k")}).</p>
  
  <h3 id="three-types">Three Types of Home Insurance</h3>
  
  <h4 id="building">Building Insurance (Structure Only)</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> House walls, foundation, roof, fixtures. Covers: Fire, flood, earthquake, theft, vandalism.</p>
  <p><strong>Excludes:</strong> Furniture, electronics, appliances.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹500–₹1,500/year per ₹1L")} home value. ${formatMoney("₹50L home = ₹25k–₹75k/year")}.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹40L home")} building cover, ${formatMoney("₹2L fire damage")} → Insurer pays ${formatMoney("₹2L")}.</p>
  
  <h4 id="contents">Contents Insurance (Belongings Only)</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> Furniture, electronics, appliances, clothes. Covers: Theft, fire, damage to contents.</p>
  <p><strong>Excludes:</strong> House structure itself.</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹200–₹500/year per ₹1L")} contents value.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹15L contents")} (furniture, TV, fridge), theft → Insurer covers replacement cost.</p>
  
  <h4 id="landlord">Landlord Insurance (For Rented Homes)</h4>
  <p><strong>What:</strong> Building structure + loss of rent (if tenant doesn't pay).</p>
  <p><strong>Cost:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹20k–₹50k/year")} (higher than owner-occupied).</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> Tenant defaults on ${formatMoney("₹20k/month rent")}; insurance covers 6 months (${formatMoney("₹1.2L")}).</p>
  
  <h3 id="coverage-areas">Key Coverage Areas</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Fire:</strong> Most common peril. Covers repair costs.</li>
    <li><strong>Burglary/theft:</strong> Stolen items replaced (up to sum insured).</li>
    <li><strong>Vandalism:</strong> Malicious damage covered.</li>
    <li><strong>Natural calamities:</strong> Flood, earthquake, storm (check what's covered).</li>
    <li><strong>Third-party liability:</strong> Visitor injured in your home → medical costs covered.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="exclusions">What Home Insurance DOESN'T Cover</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Wear and tear (old paint, old roof)</li>
    <li>Poor maintenance leading to damage</li>
    <li>Mechanical/electrical failure</li>
    <li>Substandard construction</li>
    <li>War/riots (sometimes; varies by policy)</li>
  </ul>

export const article12FAQs = [
  {
    question: "Is home insurance mandatory?",
    answer: "No, but highly recommended. If you have a home loan, banks usually require building insurance. Without insurance, one disaster (fire, flood) can wipe out your biggest asset."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between building and contents?",
    answer: "Building = structure (walls, roof, foundation). Contents = belongings (furniture, electronics). You can buy them separately or combined. Combined is usually cheaper."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim for depreciation?",
    answer: "Depreciation applies to contents (furniture, electronics lose value over time). New-for-old policies (higher premium) replace items at current market price without depreciation deduction."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my home is partially damaged?",
    answer: "Insurer pays for repair costs up to sum insured. If damage is ₹2L and sum insured is ₹50L, full ₹2L is covered. If damage exceeds sum insured, you pay the excess."
  },
  {
    question: "Is home insurance tax-deductible?",
    answer: "No, home insurance premium is NOT tax-deductible for personal homes. If property is rented out (income-generating), premium can be deducted as rental income expense."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I claim for items damaged before policy?",
    answer: "No. Only damage that occurs after policy start date is covered. Pre-existing damage is excluded. Policy starts from issue date, not purchase date."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I discover damage months later?",
    answer: "Report damage immediately (within 24–48 hours). Delayed reporting can lead to claim denial. Insurers require prompt reporting to prevent fraud."
  },
  {
    question: "Is jewelry covered?",
    answer: "Jewelry is usually covered but with sub-limits (e.g., ₹1L–₹2L maximum). Requires separate valuation and documentation. Expensive jewelry may need separate floater policy."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need separate coverage for earthquake?",
    answer: "Yes, in most policies. Earthquake is often an add-on (extra premium). In high-seismic zones (Delhi, Mumbai, North East), earthquake coverage is essential—add it."
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I review my coverage?",
    answer: "Annually, when renewing. Property values increase (inflation), contents value changes (new purchases). Ensure sum insured matches current replacement cost (not purchase price)."

  <p>General insurance covers everything except life: health, vehicle, home, travel, business, marine, liability, and more.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Simple definition:</strong> General insurance = all insurance that isn't life insurance. You pay premium. If covered event happens (accident, fire, theft, illness), insurer pays claim. No maturity benefit (unlike life insurance).</p>
  
  <h3 id="types-general">Types of General Insurance in India</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Medical expenses, hospitalization (${formatMoney("₹5k–₹15k/year")} premium)</li>
    <li><strong>Vehicle Insurance:</strong> Car/bike damage, third-party liability (${formatMoney("₹2k–₹15k/year")})</li>
    <li><strong>Home Insurance:</strong> Building + contents protection (${formatMoney("₹20k–₹75k/year")})</li>
    <li><strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> Trip cancellation, medical abroad (${formatMoney("₹500–₹3k/trip")})</li>
    <li><strong>Business Insurance:</strong> Fire, liability, key person (varies)</li>
    <li><strong>Marine Insurance:</strong> Cargo in transit (${formatMoney("₹10k+")})</li>
    <li><strong>Liability Insurance:</strong> Professional indemnity, public liability</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="vs-life">General Insurance vs Life Insurance</h3>
  <p><strong>General Insurance:</strong> Annual premium, covers specific risks, no maturity benefit, claims-based (pay if event happens).</p>
  <p><strong>Life Insurance:</strong> Long-term premium, covers death risk, maturity benefit (endowment/whole life), death-based payout.</p>
  
  <h3 id="regulation">Regulation</h3>
  <p>All general insurance in India is regulated by IRDAI (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority). All insurers must follow IRDAI guidelines for claims, pricing, coverage.</p>

export const article14FAQs = [

  },
  {
    question: "Is general insurance mandatory?",
    answer: "Some types are mandatory: Third-party vehicle insurance (by law). Health insurance for government employees (CGHS/ESIC). Most other general insurance is optional but recommended."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have multiple general insurance policies?",
    answer: "Yes. You can have health + vehicle + home insurance from different insurers. However, you cannot claim same incident from multiple policies (no double-dipping)."
  },
  {
    question: "Do general insurance policies have surrender value?",
    answer: "No. General insurance (health, vehicle, home) has no surrender value. If you cancel mid-term, you get pro-rata refund for unused period, but no cash value buildup like life insurance."
  },
  {
    question: "How are premiums calculated?",
    answer: "Based on risk: age, health (health insurance), car value/age (vehicle), property value (home), destination (travel). Higher risk = higher premium. Premiums reviewed annually."

<div class="blog-article-content">
  <h2 id="term-life-basics">Term Life Insurance Basics</h2>
  <p>Term life is the cheapest, purest form of life insurance. ${formatMoney("₹500/month")} for ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} coverage. No investment component. No maturity benefit. Pure protection.</p>
  
  <h3 id="what-term-life">What Is Term Life?</h3>
  <p>You pay premium. If you die during policy term → family gets sum assured. If you survive → you get nothing. Premium is the cost of protection.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Example:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹1cr")} term life, 30-year term, age 35. Premium: ${formatMoney("₹400/month")}. If death in year 10: Family gets ${formatMoney("₹1cr")}. If survival: ${formatMoney("₹0")} (₹1.44L total premiums paid = cost of protection).</p>
  
  <h3 id="why-term-life">Why Term Life?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cheapest:</strong> ${formatMoney("₹400/month")} vs ${formatMoney("₹2k/month")} for endowment (same ₹1cr coverage)</li>
    <li><strong>Pure protection:</strong> No investment confusion. You're buying protection, not savings.</li>
    <li><strong>High coverage:</strong> Can afford ₹1cr+ coverage on modest income</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible:</strong> Choose term (10–40 years), sum assured (₹50L–₹5cr)</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3 id="who-needs-term">Who Needs Term Life?</h3>
  <p><strong>Young professionals (25–40):</strong> Premiums are lowest. Lock in low rates early.</p>
  <p><strong>Parents with dependents:</strong> Kids' education, living expenses secured if you die.</p>
  <p><strong>Breadwinners with loans:</strong> Home loan, car loan cleared if you die.</p>
  <p><strong>Business owners:</strong> Key person insurance protects business continuity.</p>
  
  <h3 id="term-life-myths">Common Myths</h3>
  <p><strong>"Term life is waste—you get nothing if you survive":</strong> Wrong. Premium is protection cost, like car insurance. You hope you never claim, but you're protected.</p>
  <p><strong>"Endowment is better—you get money back":</strong> Endowment costs 4–5× more. That extra premium invested in mutual funds would give 10–12% returns vs 5–6% from endowment.</p>

export const article16FAQs = [
  {
    question: "Why is term life cheaper than endowment?",
    answer: "Term life has no savings/investment component—pure protection. Endowment combines protection + savings, so premiums are 4–5× higher. You're paying for both protection and investment returns."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I survive the term?",
    answer: "You get nothing. Premium paid is the cost of protection (like car insurance). If you want money back, buy endowment—but it costs 4–5× more. Better: Buy term + invest difference in mutual funds (10–12% returns)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I renew term life after term ends?",
    answer: "No. Term life is fixed-term (10–40 years). After term ends, coverage stops. You can buy a new policy, but premiums will be higher (you're older). That's why buy long-term (30–40 years) when young."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the right term length?",
    answer: "Until your dependents are financially independent. If kids are 5 years old, buy 25-year term (until they're 30). If you're 35 with 30-year home loan, buy 30-year term."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert term life to whole life?",
    answer: "Some policies offer conversion option (within first few years). Premiums will increase significantly (whole life is 5–10× more expensive). Usually not recommended—term life is better value."

    question: "Is insurance worth the cost?",
    answer: "Yes. One hospitalization (₹5L) = 50 years of health insurance premiums. One accident claim (₹2L) = 20 years of vehicle premiums. Insurance is risk management, not investment."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I choose the right insurance?",
    answer: "Assess your risks: Age, health, dependents, assets, business. Match insurance to risks. Don't over-insure (waste money) or under-insure (exposed to risk). Get advice if needed."
